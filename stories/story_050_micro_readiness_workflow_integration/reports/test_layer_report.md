# Test Layer Report

## Story

story_050_micro_readiness_workflow_integration

## Final status

PASSED

## Beginner-friendly explanation

Story test plans describe the testing layers that must be considered before review. A story does
not need a brand-new test in every layer, but it must say whether each layer is required, what
action was taken or planned, how often it should run, and what evidence or reason supports that
choice.

## Test layers

### unit_tests

Small tests for focused functions, classes, and validation rules.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: True
- Action: add_or_update
- Frequency: every_commit
- Evidence or reason: Add tests for workflow-run prepare dry-run and execute step sequence, micro-readiness step result recording, project-status display and malformed handling, next-step missing micro-readiness guidance, TOO_LARGE_FOR_MICRO guidance, READY_FOR_MICRO continuation, and warning guidance.

### integration_tests

Tests that exercise connected modules or command paths together.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: True
- Action: add_or_update
- Frequency: every_pull_request
- Evidence or reason: CLI paths are covered by existing workflow-run, project-status, and next-step tests without real local or cloud model calls.

### mock_e2e_tests

End-to-end style checks that use mocks instead of real external systems.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: True
- Action: confirm_existing
- Frequency: before_merge
- Evidence or reason: Existing workflow-run coverage exercises deterministic local story phases; this story extends the prepare allowlist only.

### live_read_only_checks

Safe live checks that only read from real services or environments.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: False
- Action: not_applicable_with_reason
- Frequency: manual_only
- Evidence or reason: Micro-readiness reads local story files only and does not require live model servers or cloud credentials.

### remote_dev_smoke_tests

Basic checks after deploying or running in a remote dev environment.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: False
- Action: not_applicable_with_reason
- Frequency: after_remote_dev_deploy
- Evidence or reason: This story does not deploy to a remote dev environment.

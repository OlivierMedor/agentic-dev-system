# Test Layer Report

## Story

story_054_codex_first_tiered_runtime_defaults

## Final status

PASSED

## Beginner-friendly explanation

Story test plans describe the testing layers that must be considered before review. A story does
not need a brand-new test in every layer, but it must say whether each layer is required, what
action was taken or planned, how often it should run, and what evidence or reason supports that
choice.

## Test layers

### unit_tests

Small tests for focused functions, classes, and validation rules.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: True
- Action: add_or_update
- Frequency: every_commit
- Evidence or reason: Add deterministic tests that validate runtime-config defaults, required agents, docs_agent provider, role model tiers, optional local helper micro mode, cloud_reviewer manual provider, and Codex task model recommendations.

### integration_tests

Tests that exercise connected modules or command paths together.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: True
- Action: confirm_existing
- Frequency: every_pull_request
- Evidence or reason: Existing runtime-config CLI and codex-task tests exercise config validation and task generation without model calls.

### mock_e2e_tests

End-to-end style checks that use mocks instead of real external systems.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: True
- Action: confirm_existing
- Frequency: before_merge
- Evidence or reason: Existing workflow-run and story generation checks exercise generated story workspace behavior without invoking agents or models.

### live_read_only_checks

Safe live checks that only read from real services or environments.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: False
- Action: not_applicable_with_reason
- Frequency: manual_only
- Evidence or reason: Runtime defaults and docs are local deterministic files and do not need live services.

### remote_dev_smoke_tests

Basic checks after deploying or running in a remote dev environment.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: False
- Action: not_applicable_with_reason
- Frequency: after_remote_dev_deploy
- Evidence or reason: This story does not deploy to a remote dev environment.

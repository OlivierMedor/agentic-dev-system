# Developer Agent Prompt

## Agent Identity

## Story Name

## Story File Content

# STORY-035: Public Repo Polish

## Goal

Polish the public-facing GitHub repository so a visitor can quickly understand what the agentic-dev-system is, why it exists, how to run it, and why it is safe/conservative.

## Why This Matters

The repository needs a sharper first impression for public visitors, including a clear README, CI badge, quick demo, safety explanation, and suggested GitHub repo metadata.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Add Story 035 to blueprints/blueprint.yaml.
- Improve README.md public presentation.
- Add a CI badge near the top of README.md.
- Add a concise Quick Demo section.
- Add a Why this project matters section.
- Add a Safety model section or improve the existing one.
- Add docs/repo_settings.md with suggested GitHub description, topics, website field, public repo settings, and license note.
- Update docs/system_map.md if the public-facing map can be clearer.
- Update docs/golden_path.md if the operator flow needs clearer wording.
- Update docs/public_launch_checklist.md if needed.
- Add or update tests that verify the new public-facing docs and README links exist.
- Do not add major new CLI features.
- Do not expose private prompts, private strategies, secrets, or generated runtime artifacts.

## Not In Scope

- No major new CLI features.
- No cloud model calls.
- No automatic merge, deployment, repository visibility change, or approval.
- No automatic license selection or LICENSE file creation.
- No private prompts, private strategy guidance, secrets, or generated runtime artifacts.

## Definition of Done

- docker compose build passes.
- pytest passes.
- ruff passes.
- artifact-policy passes.
- public-readiness passes.
- runtime-config validate passes.
- project-status runs.
- Story reports are written for development, testing, and local review.
- Review bundle is generated for Story 035 but generated bundle files are not committed.
```

## Agent Responsibility

Implement only the approved story scope. Do not write tests.

## Expected Output

reports/developer_report.md

## Project Rules

```yaml
rules:
  - Developer agent must not write tests.
  - Test agent must write tests independently.
  - Human approval is required before merge.
  - Do not commit secrets, API keys, private keys, or .env files.
```

## Quality Gates

```yaml
quality_gates:
  - tests_required
  - docs_required
  - review_bundle_required
  - local_review_required
```

## Test Plan

```yaml
test_layers_version: 1
unit_tests:
  required: true
  action: add_or_update
  frequency: every_commit
  evidence_or_reason: Add docs tests confirming the README badge, Quick Demo, required
    docs links, and repo settings guide content.
integration_tests:
  required: true
  action: confirm_existing
  frequency: every_pull_request
  evidence_or_reason: Existing CLI and workflow tests cover command behavior; this
    story changes public documentation and repository hygiene tests.
mock_e2e_tests:
  required: true
  action: confirm_existing
  frequency: before_merge
  evidence_or_reason: Existing mock E2E workflow coverage exercises the local story
    workflow.
live_read_only_checks:
  required: false
  action: not_applicable_with_reason
  frequency: scheduled_or_before_release
  evidence_or_reason: This story reads local files and does not call live external
    APIs.
remote_dev_smoke_tests:
  required: false
  action: not_applicable_with_reason
  frequency: after_remote_dev_deploy
  evidence_or_reason: This story does not deploy to a remote dev environment.
```

## Monitoring Plan

```yaml
logs_required: true
watch_for:
- missing_readme_badge
- stale_readme_link
- missing_repo_settings
- private_guidance_tracked
- committed_generated_artifact
```

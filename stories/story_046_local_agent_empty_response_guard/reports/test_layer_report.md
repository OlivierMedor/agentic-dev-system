# Test Layer Report

## Story

story_046_local_agent_empty_response_guard

## Final status

PASSED

## Beginner-friendly explanation

Story test plans describe the testing layers that must be considered before review. A story does
not need a brand-new test in every layer, but it must say whether each layer is required, what
action was taken or planned, how often it should run, and what evidence or reason supports that
choice.

## Test layers

### unit_tests

Small tests for focused functions, classes, and validation rules.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: True
- Action: add_or_update
- Frequency: every_commit
- Evidence or reason: Add tests for empty response failure, whitespace response failure, non-empty success, content list extraction, choices[0].text extraction, output_text extraction, raw response JSON saving, metadata response_character_count, draft status on empty content, run-prompt empty failure, safety boundaries, artifact/public-readiness blocking, and docs wording.

### integration_tests

Tests that exercise connected modules or command paths together.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: True
- Action: add_or_update
- Frequency: every_pull_request
- Evidence or reason: Existing CLI tests cover local-agent command output paths; unit tests exercise command behavior with fake HTTP clients.

### mock_e2e_tests

End-to-end style checks that use mocks instead of real external systems.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: True
- Action: confirm_existing
- Frequency: before_merge
- Evidence or reason: Existing mock E2E workflow coverage exercises the local story workflow; local model calls are unit-tested with fake HTTP clients.

### live_read_only_checks

Safe live checks that only read from real services or environments.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: False
- Action: not_applicable_with_reason
- Frequency: manual_only
- Evidence or reason: Live local model calls depend on optional host-side LM Studio or Ollama setup and are not required in automated tests.

### remote_dev_smoke_tests

Basic checks after deploying or running in a remote dev environment.

- Validation status: PASSED
- Required: False
- Action: not_applicable_with_reason
- Frequency: after_remote_dev_deploy
- Evidence or reason: This story does not deploy to a remote dev environment.
